## Introduction

At this point in our Codecool carrier we were experts in python, and had some experience with html, css, and SQL. JavaScript was quite new for us and it was time to put our skills to the test.

Our task was to make a game that runs in the browser. We had some good ideas, but ultimately decided on Black jack.

## Prerequisites

- Modern browser
- python

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/freestyle-javascript-game-javascript-andi-bartus
cd freestyle-javascript-game-javascript-andi-bartus
```
for python:
```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

## Gameplay

1. Enter two names
2. Place your bets and hit start
3. Click on the pack to hit or click on stay
4. Dealer comes last
